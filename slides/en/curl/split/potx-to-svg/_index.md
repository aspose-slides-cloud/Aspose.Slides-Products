1. Create an account at <a href="https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/">Dashboard</a> to get free API quota & authorization details
1. Initialize ```SlidesApi``` with Client Id and Client Secret
1. Call one of the split methods, depending where is your input POTX file and where you want to store the resultant SVG files
    - ```Split``` to split a file on storage and save the result to the storage. Each slide of the input POTX is saved as a separate SVG in the specified storage folder (or to the input file folder by default).
    - ```SplitOnline``` to split a local file and download the result as a ZIP archive. Each slide of the input POTX is downloaded as a separate SVG within the ZIP archive.
    - ```SplitAndSaveOnline``` to split a local file and save the result to the storage. Each slide of the input POTX is saved as a separate SVG in the specified storage folder (or to the root folder by default).

Get Slides Cloud SDK for cURL source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/aspose-slides-cloud/aspose-slides-cloud-curl) to compile the SDK yourself or head to the [Releases](https://releases.aspose.cloud/) for alternative download options. 

Also have a look at Swagger-based [API Reference](https://apireference.aspose.cloud/slides/) to know more about the [SLIDES REST API](https://products.aspose.cloud/slides/curl/).
