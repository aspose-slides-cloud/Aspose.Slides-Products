1. Create an account at <a href="https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/">Dashboard</a> to get free API quota & authorization details
1. Initialize ```SlidesApi``` with Client Id and Client Secret
1. Call one of the split methods, depending where is your input OTP file and where you want to store the resultant OTP files
    - ```split``` to split a file on storage and save the result to the storage. Each slide of the input OTP is saved as a separate OTP in the specified storage folder (or to the input file folder by default).
    - ```splitOnline``` to split a local file and download the result as a ZIP archive. Each slide of the input OTP is downloaded as a separate OTP within the ZIP archive.
    - ```splitAndSaveOnline``` to split a local file and save the result to the storage. Each slide of the input OTP is saved as a separate OTP in the specified storage folder (or to the root folder by default).
