1. Create an account at <a href="https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/">Dashboard</a> to get free API quota & authorization details
1. Initialize ```SlidesApi``` with Client Id and Client Secret
1. Call one of the split methods, depending where is your input PPTM file and where you want to store the resultant TIFF files
    - ```Split``` to split a file on storage and save the result to the storage. Each slide of the input PPTM is saved as a separate TIFF in the specified storage folder (or to the input file folder by default).
    - ```SplitOnline``` to split a local file and download the result as a ZIP archive. Each slide of the input PPTM is downloaded as a separate TIFF within the ZIP archive.
    - ```SplitAndSaveOnline``` to split a local file and save the result to the storage. Each slide of the input PPTM is saved as a separate TIFF in the specified storage folder (or to the root folder by default).
